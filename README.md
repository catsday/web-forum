## Testing

### Key Testing Areas
The handlers package in the Forum application includes a series of tests to ensure that API endpoints and database interactions function correctly. This testing suite uses httptest to simulate HTTP requests and assert from the testify package for validation. Mock objects are employed to isolate the tests and mimic database behavior.
1. GetHandler Tests:
   - Verifies the GetHandler correctly fetches data and handles errors.
   - Ensures proper HTTP status codes and headers are set.
2. PostHandler Tests:
   - Validates the insertion of new data through the PostHandler.
   - Tests edge cases, such as empty body submissions.
3. AddPostToCategoryHandler Tests:
   - Confirms correct linking of posts to categories, ensuring post IDs and category IDs are passed correctly.
4. GetCategory Tests:
   - Validates fetching of category data by ID, including handling errors like "not found."
5. Stress Testing:
   - Simulates multiple concurrent requests to ensure the handlers can handle high traffic without issues.

### Running Tests
To run the tests, use the following command:
```
go test ./internal/handlers
```

## Conclusion
The Forum project is a comprehensive and interactive platform for engaging discussions. With powerful features, intuitive design, and scalable architecture, it serves as a good project for interaction. Hope to your audit.
